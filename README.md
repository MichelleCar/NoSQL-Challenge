# NoSQL-Challenge
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## An Exploration of NoSQL Databases Using MongoDB

MongoDB stands at the root of the construction of many applications by industry giants.  Companie including Forbes, Toyota, Vodafone, and Verizon, to name only a few of the more than 35,000 customers, have built applications using this powerhouse NoSQL technology.

NoSQL databases are particularly ideal for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications. They are widely recognized for their ease of development, functionality, and performance at scale. They use a variety of data models for accessing and managing data. NoSQL databases are optimized for applications that require large data volume, low latency, and flexible data models, which are achieved by relaxing some of the data consistency restrictions of other databases.

MongoDB is a document database with a high degree of scalability and flexibility.  In application code, data is represented often as an object or JSON-like document because it is an efficient and intuitive data model for developers. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document model format that they use in their application code. The flexible, semistructured, and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows them to evolve with applications’ needs. The document model works well with catalogs, user profiles, and content management systems where each document is unique and evolves over time.

### Advantages of MongoDB
Here are some of the advantages offered by MongoDB:
* It is easy to install, use and schema-less database.
* Due to it is the ability of a schema-less database, the code which we create defines the schema.
* Data is stored in Binary JSON format, which is key-value pair, no joins complexity is needed.
* It uses RAM to store data; this makes faster access to the data.
* It supports replication; if the primary server goes down during transaction, then the secondary server handles the transaction without human interaction.
* It is cost-effective because it reduces cost on hardware and storage.
* It can save a lot of data which will help in faster query processing.

### Disadvantages of MongoDB
* MongoDB doesn’t support joins like a relational database. Yet one can use joins functionality by adding by coding it manually. But it may slow execution and affect performance.
* MongoDB stores key names for each value pair. Also, due to no functionality of joins, there is data redundancy. This results in increasing unnecessary usage of memory.
* You can have a document size, not more than 16MB.
* You cannot perform the nesting of documents for more than 100 levels.
